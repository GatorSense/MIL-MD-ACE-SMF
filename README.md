# MIL-MD-ACE-SMF
In this repository, we provide the paper and code reconstructed from "Multiple Instance Learning for Multiple Diverse Hyperspectral Target Characterizations" manuscript. We are not the original authors of the algorithm.

## Cloning
The https://github.com/GatorSense/Multi-Target-MI-ACE_SMF is a submodule in this repo. When you clone the project, by default you get the directories that contain the submodule, but none of the files within them yet. In order to retrieve the files two commands need to be run.
git submodule init: to initalize your local configuration file
git submodule update: to fetch all the data from that project.
